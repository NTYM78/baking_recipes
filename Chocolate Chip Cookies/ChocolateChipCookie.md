**Note**: Use **REAL** butter instead of margerine (Vegetable spread).      
**Tip**: For a better chocolatey experience, use couverture chocolate (With cocoa butter) instead of compound chocolate (With vegetable fats). 

## Making the dough
1. Melt butter in a pan / microwave. **Note**: The cold butter will eventually lose some water as it melts, ensure you end up with 118g of melted butter in the end. (Use a little more butter ~125g).
2. Add white sugar, brown sugar and salt into a mixing bowl. 
3. Add the melted butter to the sugar bowl and mix using a whisk.
4. Once mixed, add a room temperature egg and vanilla into the mixture and mix.
5. Prepare another dry bowl and sift the flour, baking powder and baking soda into it.
6. Mix the dry bowl into the wet mixture and fold using a spatula.
7. Do not over mix it if you want to avoid a cakey-like texture for your cookie.
8. When the dough is almost mixed in with all the flour (some flour still visible), add the chocolate chips into the bowl and mix.
9. Chill the dough in the fridge for at least 2 hours. I usually do overnight. This will enhance the cookie's flavour.

## Baking the cookie
1. Preheat the oven at 170°C. (Convection oven) 
1. Bring out the cookie dough from the fridge and let it thaw for awhile or till its less firm. (Not too long as it will start to melt).
2. Shape the cookie dough into round balls (~20g) using either an ice cream scooper, or by hand. **Tip**: To get a more craggy and textured cookie, don't roll the balls too smoothly but rather press it into shape.
3. Place them onto a baking sheet with some space between the doughs. 
4. Bake the cookies at 170°C for 11 minutes. Occasionally flipping the tray around once if your oven baked unevenly like mine (The back bakes faster).
5. Once baked, let the cookies chill on a cooling rack before serving. 

>**NOTE**: You can make the cookies larger, just ensure you increase the baking time according.
